The default Raspberry Pi Pico UART TX pin (out from Raspberry Pi Pico) is pin GP0, and the UART RX pin (in to
Raspberry Pi Pico) is pin GP1. The default UART pins are configured on a per-board basis using board configuration
files. The Raspberry Pi Pico configuration can be found in https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/blob/master/
src/boards/include/boards/pico.h. The SDK defaults to a board name of Raspberry Pi Pico if no other board is
specified.

The destination for stdout can be changed using CMake directives, with output directed to UART or USB CDC, or to both,
pico_enable_stdio_usb(hello_world 1) ①
pico_enable_stdio_uart(hello_world 0) ②
1. Enable printf output via USB CDC (USB serial)
2. Disable printf output via UART

If you are intending to using SWD for debugging (see Chapter 6) you need to use a UART based serial connection as
the USB stack will be paused when the RP2040 cores are stopped during debugging, which will cause any attached
USB devices to disconnect.

 Powering the board
You can unplug the Raspberry Pi Pico from USB, and power the board by additionally connecting the Raspberry Pi’s 5V
pin to the Raspberry Pi Pico VSYS pin via a diode, see Figure 5, where in the ideal case the diode would be a Schottky
diode.

The functions defined here provide a much more powerful and user friendly wrapping around the low level hardware timer functionality. For these functions (and any other SDK functionality e.g. timeouts, that relies on them) to work correctly, the hardware timer should not be modified. i.e. it is expected to be monotonically increasing once per microsecond. Fortunately there is no need to modify the hardware timer as any functionality you can think of that isn't already covered here can easily be modelled by adding or subtracting a constant value from the unmodified hardware timer.
